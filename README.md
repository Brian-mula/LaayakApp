### "An online class management system where students get all announcements and class links in realtime"

<h1 align=center> Overview üéá </h1>
<p align="center">One of the major problems faced by college students and professors in this pandemic is inefficient communication regarding online lectures, important announcements, etc. As different professors may use different portals of communication sometimes the student may miss out on something important. Also, links to lectures also get mixed up when they are forwarded by the class representative leading to utter confusion and chaos. Thus the need of the hour is a dedicated and exclusive portal where we get all of our notifications in real-time, at the same place for all subjects and other miscellaneous announcements.
